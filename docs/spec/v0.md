# LED Layout Tool v0

## Goal
Web app to design a pixel-accurate layout consisting of:
- Sending cards (rectangles) that define the overall working canvas (mosaic)
- Screens (groups) placed at specific coordinates
- Cabinets (tiles) placed inside screens

No port-mapping logic yet beyond "cabinet belongs to a port lane".

## Core Concepts
### Project
- Has a list of SendingCards
- Has a list of Screens
- Has a CabinetLibrary
- Derived: overall canvas bounds from sending cards union

### SendingCard
- id: string (e.g. "Tx01")
- x,y in pixels (position in global canvas)
- width,height in pixels (resolution of that sending card)
- color / label

### Screen
- id: number (e.g. 7)
- name: string
- x,y in pixels (top-left in global canvas)
- cabinets: CabinetInstance[]
- Derived: screen bounds from cabinets union

### CabinetType
- id: string
- name: string
- pxW, pxH

### CabinetInstance
- id: string
- cabinetTypeId
- x,y in pixels (position relative to screen)
- portLane: integer (optional; used for "drag cabinets per port lane")

## UI Requirements (v0)
- Single page app, split layout:
  - Left sidebar: project settings + library + tools
  - Center: canvas with pan/zoom
  - Right panel: properties for selected object

### Canvas
- Displays sending cards as rectangles with labels
- Displays screens as groups; screen label shown
- Cabinets drawn as tiles inside screens
- Snap-to-grid toggle:
  - grid size defaults to selected cabinet type size
- Pixel-nudge controls for selected screen (arrow buttons + input)

### Tools
- Select tool: click objects, drag to move (sending cards and screens)
- Add SendingCard: form input (id, w,h, x,y)
- Add Screen: form input (id, name, x,y)
- Cabinet stamp tool:
  - choose cabinet type
  - click inside a screen to place cabinets at snapped position
  - shift-click to paint multiple
- "Port lanes" mode (simple):
  - user chooses lane number in toolbar
  - cabinets placed get that lane number; tiles in same lane show same color tag

## Save/Load
- Save project to JSON file
- Load project from JSON file

## Definition of Done
- Can create sending cards of different sizes and place them anywhere
- Can create screens at coordinates
- Can define cabinet types and place cabinets inside screens
- Can save/load a JSON project
- Runs locally: npm install, npm run dev
